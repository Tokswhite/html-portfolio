<h1>The Best Movies According to Toks</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>John Wick 4</h3>

<p>
<h4>This is my favourite movies. The action is so intensed. Maybe my judgement was based on high adrenalin rush. The lession from the movie is that, as the 
system, be it economy and any other factors, be it technology or any other process are upgrading, you too have to upgrade to stay afloat/alive. So while the high table upgraded to a bullet proof suites, 
John Wick have to device an intelligent means of killing while staying alive.<br />
The movie also lay emphassis on friendship, trust, betrayers, loyalty. Even with the beliefs that 
there are no trust and loyalty in mafia world, loyalty is a personal principle but earn in due time.<br />
It's also makes it clear that when you are good at what you do, improvicing will look like it was reharsed over time.</h4>

<h3>Game of Throne</h3>
<p>
<h4>The entire series is so interesting. Following the battle btween trust and betrayal makes the Game of Throne the movie to watch. The strategies, plans and the execution of well thought out plans 
 to attack a city and act of leaking the informations makes it look more like the real life situation.<br />
 The high point for me is the love, hate, and betrayals within the family. How they choose sides and tend to be loyal is the game changer.<br />
 The only downside for me is the wait for a new season can be frustrating. The anxiety is killing.

<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</h3>

<p>
<h4>This movie tells all about the power of love. Tasking the couples to choose between carreer and love is always going to be a diffcult option to take.<br />Especially after being together for so long and you are not sure the feelings any more.
It is a test of love. And how they were trying to kill each other while not trying to kill each other is fascinating.<br />Its takes lots of courage to want to kill each and when the opportunity presented itself, you couldnt take. <br />
It shows true love can conquer all. </h4>
